## Hi there, I'm Mathias! 👋

### 🔍 About Me 🏆
I'm a PhD candidate in Statistics with a strong interest in **quantitative finance, time series volatility, risk management, and machine learning**. My research focuses on **Dynamic Risk Parity Portfolio Selection with Independent Component Analysis**, and I also explore topics in **cyber risk quantification, systemic risk modeling, and model validation frameworks**.

I'm passionate about applying statistical and machine learning techniques to **financial risk assessment**, aiming to bridge the gap between academia and industry. My goal is to leverage these skills for a career in **data science within the insurance or banking sector**.
